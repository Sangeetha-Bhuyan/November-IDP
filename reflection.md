The "six things" (variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops, objects): I used variables to define things about the snake like how it grows, how it moves, its size. I used conditionals to dictate the direction of the snake based on different keys pressed. I used functions the separate smaller sectiosn of the larger project like building the actual snake and then building how it moves. Loops were used to repeat the code and keep the game running. 

Revisions made: I used a coding challenge video refernece to build this snake game taht I used to play a lot. I added a reset button so tha the game could be played multiple times easily. I also change design aspects of the game. 

Things you know now that you didn't the first time:
I did not understand how to break up a larger project or task into smaller parts and take the project step by step.
