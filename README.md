Initial goal setting: I wanted to create a game beacuse i have not done so yet for an IDP and after looking up different games that I could make, I chose the snake game because it is a game that I used to play a lot. My goal was to find a refernce to use and make a working snake game and then add onto the code.  

Updates: I found a good reference video that I could build my game foundation off of and I followed along with the explanation of the video and created my code. There were multiple times that I had to do some debugging because I missed something or typed something wrong, which was a little frustrating. I did not get a chance to add all of the extra components that I wanted like making the snake look more like a snake, but I was able to add a restart component so that after the game ends the player can restart.  

Reflection: I learned a lot about how when making something like a game you have to code specific parts in steps. It is a lots easier to put pieces together rather than try to do the whole thing at once. I also learned the importance of drawing out my ideas and what I want the computer to do.
